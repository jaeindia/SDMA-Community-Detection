# Detecting Communities in Professional Social Networks
With the increase in various social networks, including professional networks, telecommunication networks, office
networks, academic networks, etc., the use of social computing is also increasing. The combination of the social
networks with graph mining techniques has opened vast opportunities for social computing. Detecting communities
of users can be of great importance in a social network. For example, understanding the evolution of a community
may help in identifying trends and patterns, and in inferring how their properties change over time. Moreover, the
identified communities may be used to derive business insights.

LinkedIn is the most prominently used professional social network platform. LinkedIn allows professionals to
connect in various forms, follow groups based on common interests, create professional network by connecting with
people and share their profile. The users on LinkedIn share their work experience, current job status, educational
background and much other such information. We aim to leverage this information and detect communities in
LinkedIn network. We will test and apply the existing community detection algorithms - Infomap, Spectral
Clustering and Girvan-Newman on our dataset and answer the business scenarios.
